    <h1>1. What is Skincare?</h1>
    <p>As the name suggests, skincare is a method through which skin is treated and cared for. This can be through the use of products (creams, emollients, etc), nutrition and diet to supplement skin health, as well as lifestyle practises (avoiding direct sunlight, not smoking).

        There are many different categories of skincare; things you can do at home as well as treatments that can be carried out by qualified dermatologists.
        
        Ultimately the goal with skincare is to preserve and enhance the condition of the skin, as well as to achieve individual needs. Examples of common individual needs include anti-aging, reduction of acne, fading of scars and evening skin tone.
        
        While skincare may seem like a modern practise (especially with all the nifty electronics you can now purchase for at-home use) evidence of it’s use spans across several centuries.</p>

    <p>Looking after your skin is a critical procedure in maintaining skin youthfulness and clarity. The skin does indeed look after itself, though only to a certain extent. Some external effort is needed to supplement this.

        You shed thousands of dead skin cells every day and your skin self-moisturises by producing sebum, it is indeed a very effective system. Sebum is a waxy secretion that your pores secrete to keep the skin hydrated and protected.
        
        But what happens if your skin is naturally dry, or if you suffer from hormonal acne? This is exactly where skincare becomes a <mark>Critical procedure.</mark>Sometimes your skin cannot take care of itself as effectively as you’d want it to. This can be due to a medical condition, environmental effects, genetics, and lifestyle choices. This is where you can step in.

        By practising good skincare you can drastically improve the condition of your skin; for most this improves self-image; most people agree that the condition of their skin is a factor influencing self-worth and mental health.
        
        Not only is skincare important for mental health, but also from a medical standpoint. By practising good lifestyle habits such as avoiding direct sunlight and applying SPF, you’re reducing the probability of skin cancer caused by UV rays.
        
        In addition to preventing cancer, medical breakthroughs have improved the quality of life for many suffering from skin conditions. Examples of such conditions include cystic acne, psoriasis, and eczema. Various emollients and ointments have been developed to help this demographic with their skin concerns.</p>
